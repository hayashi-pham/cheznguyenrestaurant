# Agent Guidelines

This repository uses this file to document working agreements for all contributors.

- Follow the workflow and quality expectations outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Adhere to the engineering practices in `CODE_STANDARDS.md` for any code or content changes.
- Prefer `npm run lint` when modifying application code; for documentation-only changes, linting is optional.
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive. Group related edits into a single commit when practical.

These instructions apply to the entire repository unless overridden by a more specific `AGENTS.md`.
