# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve the Chez Nguyen Restaurant site! This guide summarizes how to work effectively in this repository.

## Getting started
- Use Node.js 18+ and npm.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server locally.

## Workflow expectations
- Create focused branches and keep pull requests scoped to a single concern.
- For application code changes, run `npm run lint` before opening a PR. For documentation-only changes, linting is optional.
- Include clear commit messages that summarize the change.
- Update documentation when you introduce or modify notable behavior.

## Pull request checklist
- [ ] The change follows the conventions in `CODE_STANDARDS.md`.
- [ ] UI changes are accessible (labels, focus styles, semantic elements) and responsive.
- [ ] New components and pages are covered by appropriate stories, examples, or usage notes.
- [ ] You have considered internationalization for user-facing text when applicable.

## Support and questions
If you are unsure about a decision, prefer small, incremental PRs and document trade-offs in the description. This keeps reviewers aligned and reduces back-and-forth.
